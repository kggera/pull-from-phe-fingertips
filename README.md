# pull-from-phe-fingertips
This scipt enables you to search for and save specific indicators for specific geographies on PHE Fingertips. You do not need python coding experience to run the code.

The script provides text prompts for you to:
- enter a search term for Fingertips indicators
- select Fingertips indicators that you are interested in
- select specific geographies (e.g. CCG or GP) for each indicator
- save the final outputs as separate csv files

## Usage
As mentioned, you do not need python experience to run the script. However, you will need to do the following in order for the script to work:
1. Download Jupyter Notebook and python (most easily done by downloading Anaconda Navigator) or use Google Collaboratory
2. Navigate to wherever you have saved the python file from this repository (Jupyter notebook should open in your browser and present you with a file directory)
3. Run the first cell (shift + Enter), which installs the python package for Fingertips (this only needs to be done once, after which you can delete or comment out that line of code (see instructions in the first cell))
4. Run subsequent cells (shift + Enter) and follow any instructions printed out at the bottom of each cell
5. Update the file path in the final cell (using forward slashes) to wherever you want the final outputs to be saved and then save your outputs by running the cell

The beginning of each cell explains the broad purpose of the code and there are also line-by-line code descriptions.
